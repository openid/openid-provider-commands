# OpenID Provider Commands 1.0

This repository contains the OpenID Provider Commands specification.


## Overview

OpenID Provider (OP) Commands complements OpenID Connect by introducing a set of Commands for an OP to directly manage an end-user Account at an RP. These Commands enable an OP to activate, maintain, suspend, reactivate, archive, restore, delete, and unauthorize an end-user Account. Command Tokens build on the OpenID Connect ID Token schema and verification, simplifying adoption by RPs.
